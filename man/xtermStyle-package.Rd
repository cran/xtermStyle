\details{
  Text formatting in xterm and ansi terminals using escape
  sequences. Supports colors and various font styles. It
  began as a standalone version of the \sQuote{xterm256}
  package by Romain Francois since that package is
  interwoven with the syntax highlighting package
  \sQuote{highlight} but has been developed in another
  direction since then.

  For some more sophisticated examples of this package
  functionality check out the \sQuote{dataview} package as
  that was the very reason \sQuote{xtermStyle} came into
  existence. However as \sQuote{xtermStyle} can be used
  independently they were released separately.
