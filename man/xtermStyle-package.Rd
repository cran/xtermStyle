Text formatting in xterm and ansi terminals using escape sequences.
Supports colors and various font styles. It began as a standalone
version of the \sQuote{xterm256} package by Romain Francois since that
package is tangled up with the syntax highlighting package \sQuote{highlight}
but has been developed in another direction since then.

For some more sophisticated examples of this package functionality check out
the \sQuote{dataview} package as that was the very reason
\sQuote{xtermStyle} came into existence. However as \sQuote{xtermStyle} can
be used independently they were released separately.}
